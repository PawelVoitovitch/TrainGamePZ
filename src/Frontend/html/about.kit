                        <h2>Rules</h2>
                        <p>
                            Each player starts with a package of 35 train cars that he uses to build routes.
                            At the start of the game, each player draws a minimum of 2 ticket cards.
                            Ticket cards are used to earn points for building the route depicted on the ticket, and
                            train cards are used to build routes - the moment we have the right number of train cards of
                            a given color, we can build the corresponding route of that color on the map.
                            The rainbow train cards symbolize any color, as does the gray box on the board.
                            After every player drew their ticket cards, put the remaining in a pile next to it then draw
                            5 train cards and place them faced up in the board.<br />

                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p> After drawing cards and determining the order of players, each player every turn has one of
                            three actions available:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Create a route between cities using their train cards. The used train cards are put next
                                to them on the pile and taken out of the game.
                            </li>
                            <li>Draw 2 train cards from the board. This area is then replenished so that in each
                                player's turn it contains 5 cards.</li>
                            <li>Draw 1 ticket card.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Routes on the map can only be occupied by one player. When the train cards from the board
                            run out, used cards are taken back.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once one player has only 4 train cars available to build routes, the last turn takes place.
                            After the last turn, the points from the completed routes from each player's ticket cards
                            are counted. The player with the most points wins!</p>
